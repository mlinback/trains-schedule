# Firebase-trainapp
Train schedule application!!
Making an app using firebase to store train data.
Initialized firebase.
Then on click captured user input.
Created local object to store train data.
Created  a firebase event listner for adding trains to database and a row in the html when the user adds an entry
Created variable to set to Current Time.
Made variables timediff and timeRemainder and frequency, to get minutes till next train.
Hence to get time for next arrival of that train.

CHALLENGES faced: 
while setting time.
Though figured out that HH is used for denoting military time,instead of hh.
To understand how the moment()function works.
